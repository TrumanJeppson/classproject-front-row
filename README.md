# Introduction

The reality TV show Survivor has been airing for over 20 years, mainly due to its great success and popularity in the United States. The general plot of the show is that 16-20 selected people are taken to an uninhabited location with little supplies. These people are expected to survive, participate in challenges, and vote one person off of the game every 3 days, until there are only a few left. The winner is then chosen by the contestants who have already been voted off.  One aspect of the game that fascinates viewers is the fact that the winner is always seemingly impossible to predict among the players at first glance. Because the game not only includes fitness and intelligence, but also social factors, there is no specific "type" of person that consistently wins the game. Therefore, it is our intention in this analysis to see if a model can be created that accurately predicts whether or not a player will win the game, based solely on geographical factors. This will help in determining whether there are some types of people who have a higher tendency to win the game, regardless of how they played.
